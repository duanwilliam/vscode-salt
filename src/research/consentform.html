            Study Title and Number

            Title: A Real-World Study of Rust Learning
            Study # 808900

            2.	Principal Investigator

            Michael Coblenz, Assistant Professor, UCSD

            3.	Study Overview

            This research study is being conducted to understand how error Rust programmers understand and fix errors in their code, and to evaluate prototype tools that may help understand errors.

            We are inviting you to participate in a research study because you downloaded our Visual Studio Code extension.

            This form explains the research so that you may make an informed decision about participating.    

            Research is voluntary - whether or not you participate is your decision.  You can discuss your decision with others (such as family, friends or another physician).
            You can say yes, but change your mind later.
            If you say no, we will not hold your decision against you.
            Please ask the study doctor or study team questions about anything that is not clear, and feel free to ask questions and mention concerns before, during, and after the research.
            You may consult with friends, family, a personal doctor, or anyone else before deciding whether or not to be in the study. 
            You will be given a copy of this consent form and the Participant’s Bill of Rights.  

            The purpose of this research study is to learn how programmers learn and use Rust so that we can design and evaluate approaches to making Rust programmers more successful. We also would like to find out whether the tools we are developing help participants learn Rust more effectively.

            You will be asked to enable telemetry for this extension so that we can receive the logs of error frequency and duration of errors in your Rust programs. These logs collect error codes and time intervals between program builds to track how long it takes to resolve certain errors. You may also be randomly selected to opt-in to new features.

            The most common risks or discomforts of this study are finding the learning tools confusing or incorrect. You are free to disable the tools at any time.

            The most serious discomfort may be with not wanting to have a record of data about errors you have made while programming in Rust. While a copy of the log will be saved on your client, the data sent to our servers will not be associated with any identifiable information about you.

            A complete listing of possible risks and discomforts associated with this study can be found in Section 9 of this document.

            We cannot promise any benefit to you or to others from you participating in this research.  However, possible benefits include an easier time fixing Rust compiler errors using the features provided. Additionally, we hope to learn how to make Rust easier to use for many different Rust programmers.

            The alternative to being in this study is not to participate. 

            More detailed information about this research study is provided below.

            4.	Whom can I talk to if I have questions?

            If during your participation in the study you have questions or concerns, or if you think the research has hurt you, contact the research team at the numbers listed in Section 3 on the first page of this form. You should not agree to participate in this study until the research team has answered any questions you have about the study, including information contained in this form. 

            If before or during your participation in the study you have questions about your rights as a research participant, or you want to talk to someone outside the research team, please contact:
            UC San Diego Office of IRB Administration at 858-246-4777 or irb@ucsd.edu

            7.	How many people will take part?

            We plan to study up to 10,000 people. The research is online and will include people across all locations.

            8.	What happens if I take part in the research?

            As you read this form, ask questions if something is not clear.

            You will be asked to fill out a demographics survey and enable telemetry in the extension settings. 

            For every new feature, you will be “randomized” into one of 2 study groups: a group who may enable the feature, and a control group without the feature.

            Randomization means that you are put into a group by chance. It is like flipping a coin. Neither you nor the researchers choose which group you will be in.  You will have a 50% chance of being placed in a specific group.

            9.	What are the risks and possible discomforts?

            It is possible that features and tools made available in this study may seem confusing or incorrect, in which case you may choose to disable them. We will also be sending logs that include how frequently you build Rust programs and which types of errors you make to a cloud server. If you no longer feel comfortable participating, you may disable telemetry and log collection in the extension settings.
            Risks of Loss of Confidential Information: There is also a risk that information about you could be released to an unauthorized party. To minimize this risk, we will associate your data with a randomized hash, never storing names or IPs.

            10.	How will information about me be protected?

            While we cannot guarantee complete confidentiality, we will limit access to information about you.  Only people who have a need to review your information will have access. These people might include members of the research team and other staff or representatives of UCSD whose work is related to the research or to protecting your rights and safety.
            By agreeing to participate, data about your error messages including error codes, line numbers, and intervals between successive program builds will be logged and sent to a cloud server for analysis. We will not be collecting raw error messages, since those could include variable or function names. We may also collect information about usage of IDE features related to Rust. For example, if we provide a feature that helps fix Rust errors, we may log how often that feature is used and low-level information about the code to which it is applied (without any identifiers, such as variable or function names).

            The results of this study may be published once the study is completed. However, we will keep your name and other identifying information confidential. We expect this study will be completed in 2 years. This is only an estimate and the actual time to complete the study may be longer or shorter depending on a number of factors. 

            11.	Will I need to pay to participate in the research?

            There will be no cost to you for participating in this study.

            12.	What if I agree to participate, but change my mind later?

            You can stop participating at any time for any reason, and it will not be held against you. 

            13.	What will happen to information collected from me?

            The data we collect with your identifiable information as a part of this study may be used to answer other research questions or may be shared with other investigators for other research. If we do so, we will remove all identifiable information before use or sharing. Once identifiers have been removed, we will not ask for your consent for the use or sharing of your data in other research. In addition, data that have been de-identified may be shared for other researchers to access and use. 

            While your privacy and confidentiality are very important to us and we will use safety measures to protect it, we cannot guarantee that your identity will never become known.

            15.	Will I be compensated for participating in the research?

            If you agree to take part in this research, we will provide data and personalized analysis about your learning progress in Rust for your time and effort, if you agree to receive it in section 18. This may include a chart of your most costly errors and how your progress compares to other users of the extension.

            We will not pay you to take part in this study or pay for any out of pocket expenses related to your participation, such as travel costs.

            16.	What else is important for me to know?

            If you sign up below, you will be provided a summary of the research findings when they 
            are available.

            17.	What are my rights when providing electronic consent?

            California law provides specific rights when you are asked to provide electronic consent:
            You have the right to obtain a copy of the consent document in a non-electronic format.
            You have the right to provide consent in a non-electronic format.
